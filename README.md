To deploy the project. I researched different options: Railway, PythonAnywhere, and Render.io. I decided to try to deploy the project with Railway.
I followed the instructions in the article "How to Deploy Django Website for Free in 2023" at https://dev.to/ashishmakes/how-to-deploy-django-website-for-free-in-2023-14d6.
I thought everything was fine, but the my site kept crashing. I tried making different changes. I kept getting the error: "django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: 
Configuration cannot be imported, environment variable DJANGO_CONFIGURATION is undefined." I kept trying to fix the issue and followed the steps in the django-configurations
2.5.1 documentation at https://django-configurations.readthedocs.io/en/stable/. I still kept getting the same error. I tried to even add an index page, in case the deployment 
was crashing because I did not have one. I tried 6 different times. Nothing that I try appears to be working to solve the problem.
